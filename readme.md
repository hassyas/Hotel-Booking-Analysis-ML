#### Problem Statement
- **Objective:** Identify bookings with a high probability of cancellation.

#### Reasoning
- **Focus:** Addressing high cancellation rates which lead to reduced profits for lodging partners.

#### Goal
- **Aim:** Predict the likelihood of booking cancellations to enable lodging partners to implement double bookings and mitigate loss.

#### Benefits
- **Advantage:** More effective pricing strategies and potentially more budget-friendly rates, leading to fewer cancellations.

#### Expected Outcome
